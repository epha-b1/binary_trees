# C Binary Tree Implementation

This repository implements various operations on binary trees in the C programming language.

## What are binary trees?

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures where each node can have at most two child nodes: a left child and a right child. This structure allows for efficient searching, sorting, and traversal algorithms.

## What's in this repository?

This repository provides implementations for the following functionalities:

- **Creating and manipulating binary trees**: Functions to create new nodes, insert nodes into the tree, and free allocated memory.
- **Traversing binary trees**: Implementations for various tree traversal methods like pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Balanced binary trees (optional)**: (Some implementations may include functions for creating or checking for balanced binary trees)

## Who is this for?

This repository is a great resource for:

- Programmers learning about data structures in C.
- Anyone who wants to understand the basics of binary tree operations.
- Developers who need to implement binary trees in their C projects.
